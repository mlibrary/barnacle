# Filter an ActiveRecord::Relation (or similar) to a set of Resources for which
# the actor has a {:show} permission granted.
#
# This is implemented by finding resource tokens for which the actor has some
# credential granting {:show}, then mapping the tokens to conventional resource
# scopes and then reducing them with `.or` for the conceptual equivalent of:
#
#   SELECT * FROM Resource WHERE id IN <scope A> OR id IN <scope B>
#
# The relation must implement:
#
#   #all, #with_type(type), and #with_type_and_id(type, id), #resource_types
#

  # @param actor The user or other entity listing resources

  # @param authority [Checkpoint::Authority] The authority to consult

  # Create a ViewableResources filter for an actor and relation and execute it
  # immediately. This is a convenience factory that binds in the default
  # authority and runs {.all}.
  #
  # @example Setting a policy's base scope with minimal ceremony
  #   def base_scope
  #     ViewableResources.for(user, SomeModel.all)
  #   end
  #
  # @return [Relation] the relation filtered to accessible resources
