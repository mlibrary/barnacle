# Create a convenient policy double.
#
# The simplest construct is to supply only a hash of predicates and whether
# they should return true or false. The double returned will expect that
# authorize! is called with all supplied predicates and will raise unless the
# predicate value is truthy.
#
# Example:
#
# let(:policy) { policy_double(show?: true) }
#
# If more detailed control is needed, a block can be supplied. If this happens,
# the the block is called each time a new policy instance is created. The first
# parameter is the double itself and the rest are what is passed to the policy
# constructor. You can set more detailed responses and expectations on the
# policy instance here.
#
# Example:
#
# resource_policy = policy_double do |policy, *new_args|
#   (user, resource) = new_args
#   expect(resource.owner).to eq user
#   allow(policy).to receive(:show?).and_return(true)
#   expect(policy).to receive(:authorize!).with(:show?)
# end
#
# Note that this example is illustrating the mechanism more than a suggested
# pattern. It is roughly equivalent to the shorter form. An example of where
# this mechanism may be more useful is a case where variable permissions must
# be authorized for a given controller action, or there is a desire to mock
# variations depending on richer fixture data.

# Convenience module for settings policies on controller instances in specs.
#
# Include the module at the top level RSpec.describe, and then call
# collection_policy and/or resource_policy, typically in a before block, to
# mock the policies. These have the same behavior as policy_double and
# collection_policy_double except that they are also attached to the controller
# instance already defined within the spec.
