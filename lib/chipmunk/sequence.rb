  # A utility for processing sequences of callables that return Chipmunk::Status
  # objects.
  class Sequence

    # Call (via the #call method) each item, passing the given args, until
    # either the collection is exhausted or one of the items returns a failing
    # Status object. If no failures are encountered, this returns a successful
    # Status object. Otherwise, it returns the failed status object.
    #
    # @example Pass a release to each task's #call method
    #   Sequence.do(tasks, release)
    def self.do(items, *args)
      items.reduce(Status.success) do |last_result, item|
        break(last_result) unless last_result.success?

        item.call(*args)
      end
    end

    # Execute the block for each item, passing the item to the block, until
    # either the collection is exhausted or one of the items returns a failing
    # Status object. If no failures are encountered, this returns a successful
    # Status object. Otherwise, it returns a failed status object.
    #
    # Note that your block must return something that responds to #success?,
    # such as a Status instance.
    #
    # @example
    #   Sequence.for(commands) do |command|
    #     runner.run(command)
    #   end
    def self.for(items)
